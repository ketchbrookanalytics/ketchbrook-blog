    "text": "One of the caveats of working with your traditional vanilla machine learning algorithms (e.g., linear regression, logistic regression, decision trees, etc.) is that each case (row) in your training dataset must be independent. Let’s explore what exactly this means.\nThe way those algorithms learn is by looking at a bunch of cases: the circumstances surrounding each case, and what the outcome was for each case. The algorithm then tries to boil all of these cases down to a handful of rules that do a pretty good job at explaining how certain circumstances generally lead to particular outcomes."

    "text": "Applications in Credit Risk\nWhen we think about credit risk models, the cases are perhaps a bunch of historical loans in your portfolio where we know what the outcome was. To provide a simplified example, let’s suppose we are building a logistic regression model where the possible outcomes are (1) the loan was paid back in full or, (2) the borrower defaulted on the loan.\n\n\n\n\n\nLoan ID\nDebt Coverage Ratio\nCredit Score\nIndustry Outlook\nOutcome\n\n\n\n\n1001\n1.334\n711\nFair\nPaid in Full\n\n\n1002\n1.163\n760\nPoor\nDefault\n\n\n1003\n1.858\n740\nExcellent\nPaid in Full\n\n\n1004\n0.767\n724\nPoor\nPaid in Full\n\n\n1005\n1.346\n712\nAbove Average\nDefault\n\n\n1006\n1.966\n697\nExcellent\nPaid in Full\n\n\n1007\n1.502\n671\nExcellent\nDefault\n\n\n1008\n1.117\n743\nFair\nPaid in Full\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to create the above dataset to train our model, we had to aggregate each loan into a single observation, so that each row represents a unique loan. Remember, each case in our training data must be independent; for us this means that we cannot have any loan appear more than once. There are many approaches to doing this aggregation which we won’t cover today, but for now just remember that the approach taken should be driven by what information will be available at the time of scoring a new loan.\n\nAggregation is Limiting\nWhen we take the step of aggregating our data into unique loan-level observations, we are naturally reducing the amount of data we have to work with. If you have tons of data, this isn’t an issue. But one issue we run into often is severe class imbalance in our outcome. In other words, we tend to have a lot more “Paid in Full” cases than we have “Default” cases.\n\n“Remember, each case in our training data must be independent; for us this means that we cannot have any loan appear more than once.”\n\nBut what if we didn’t have to satisfy that independence assumption? What if we didn’t have to aggregate our data? After all, the original data in our database probably looks a lot more like this:\n\n\n\n\n\nLoan ID\nDate\nDebt Coverage Ratio\nCredit Score\nIndustry Outlook\nStatus\n\n\n\n\n1001\n2021-06-01\n1.925\n749\nExcellent\nCurrent\n\n\n1001\n2021-07-01\n1.674\n705\nGood\nCurrent\n\n\n1001\n2021-08-01\n1.334\n711\nFair\nPaid in Full\n\n\n1002\n2021-02-01\n1.199\n764\nGood\nCurrent\n\n\n1002\n2021-03-01\n1.163\n760\nPoor\nDefault\n\n\n1003\n2021-09-01\n0.644\n800\nAbove Average\nCurrent\n\n\n1003\n2021-10-01\n2.654\n728\nGood\nCurrent\n\n\n1003\n2021-11-01\n1.858\n740\nExcellent\nPaid in Full\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis type of data is sometimes referred to as “longitudinal” data, and represents observations of the same subject(s) over multiple points in time. In our case, the “subjects” are the unique loans. Clearly, the rows in this type of dataset are not independent, since we see the same loan appear more than once.\n\n\nWhat’s to be Gained\nSuppose the independence condition didn’t exist, and we could use this longitudinal data to build our logistic regression model. What would we gain by doing so?\n\nMore Data: For starters, we would have a lot more data! In situations where we don’t have a ton of data to begin with, each row of data we do have is really important. Especially when we have class imbalance in our data – we need as much information about “Default” loans as possible to help our model develop those general rules (and avoid overfitting).\nMore Signal: Second, we can give our model insight into a loan’s history in a way that we weren’t able to with our aggregated dataset. For example, it’s probably important to distinguish between a loan that defaulted after being on the books for 3 years versus one that defaulted after 3 months. You can think of this as incorporating an entire additional predictor variable into our model."

    "text": "Enter: Multi-Level Models\nLuckily for us data scientists, we know that we have a lot more tools in our toolbox than just the three algorithms mentioned at the beginning of this article. One suite of lesser-known algorithms we might explore are multi-level models.\nIf you haven’t heard of multi-level models, you may be familiar with “mixed effects” or “hierarchical” models. These three terms all refer to roughly the same thing. The big advantage of this type of model? Each case in your training data does not have to be independent. This means that we can use a dataset that looks a lot more like the second table above, as opposed to the (aggregated) first table.\n\nAnalogous Algorithms\nFortunately for us, a lot of the more traditional algorithms have multi-level analogs.\n\n\n\nAustin Powers Scene, “We’re Not So Different, You and I”\n\n\nIn fact, there are multi-level and mixed effects flavors of logistic regression that allow you to accommodate dependence between rows in your training data.\nIn our next blog post, we will dive deeper into the technical approaches to implementing these kinds of algorithms for building better credit risk models."

    "text": "Making Risk More Dynamic\nLet’s envision a world where, instead of disparate models that assess probability of default at the time of certain credit events (i.e., one model for origination, another model for renewal, a third for CECL, etc.), we have a single model that estimates PD in real-time.\nThis world is not just possible – it’s a framework that Ketchbrook Analytics has spent years developing and building out for our banking clients.\nThe value proposition for this framework includes greater flexibility, decreased risk and improved insights. The technical details of the modeling approach allow any organization to:\n\nincorporate new information (new repayment data, new economic outlook data, etc.) about a loan to continuously update it’s predicted probability of default\nlook at its portfolio on any given day and understand the current risk for a single loan, a segment of loans, or the entire portfolio\nsimulate the impact of a new deal on the portfolio during the underwriting process\n\nFrom a modeling perspective, this means that we want our inputs (predictors) to be the longitudinal attributes about the loan, and the model output to be probability of default.\n\nWith each additional on-time payment, we would expect our model to decrease the associated probability of default. Conversely, if new economic outlook data forecasts worsening industry conditions, the model should update the probability of default to show increasing risk."

    "section": "Taking a Forward-Looking Approach",
    "text": "Taking a Forward-Looking Approach\nEven more specifically, our model’s output should not be a single number – it should instead be a curve that provides us with not just a predicted probability of default, but a probability of default over the life of the loan.\nTake Loan #1234, for example. This five-year term loan just came into our bank today and passed through our model, which returned the following probability of default curve prediction:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[Tip: You can hover over the chart above – it’s interactive! Each point represents the probability of the loan defaulting at or before that date. If we want to know the probability of a specific loan (including a new loan, a renewal, or a group of existing loans in a portfolio) defaulting today, we can easily get this by looking at the left-most point on the PD curve(s). If we want to know the probability of a loan ever defaulting during its life, we can easily get this by looking at the right-most point.]\nOur model estimates that Loan #1234 has a 0.8% probability of defaulting sometime prior to the end of this year (2022), a 2.0% probability of defaulting between now and the end of 2023, and so on, with a 16.0% probability of defaulting during its life.\nFast-forward two years later, and Loan #1234 has not yet defaulted, with three years remaining on its five-year term. We have new information about this loan’s performance that we did not have at origination (e.g., repayment history), as well as updated information (e.g., industry outlook). Running it through our model again, the curve has likely changed:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the case of Loan #1234, it looks like it has been performing pretty well, since the updated probability of defaulting before term is down from 16.0% to 7.2%.\n\nOne Model to Rule Them All\nIn our toy example, we used an annual frequency along the x-axis of our charts. In practice, this frequency would be much more granular – at least monthly, and hopefully daily. Remember, the time granularity of our model’s output is tied directly to the frequency of the input data. In other words, if we get new repayment & economic outlook data each month, then (1) our model will output a predicted probability of default for each month into the future, and (2) that prediction curve can be updated each month.\n\nFrom a practical perspective, having a modeling framework that provides probability of default estimates in real-time (including origination) that updates dynamically as we get new information allows us to quickly build automated loan decisioning, scorecard lending, CECL, and stress testing models along the same probability of default framework."
